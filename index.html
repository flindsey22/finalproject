Since their founding, video games have brought us together in remarkable ways. They leave us with memories of the worlds we have traveled, people we've met, and the stories we have told.
We play them with friends for good laughs, challenge strangers across the globe, or go solo for a more focused and immersive experience. We see ourselves in the characters and spaces they inhabit. Some games 
take the cake more than others, so let me tell you about mine.</p>
